# Discord Whisper

**Whisper** is a Discord bot concept meant to record conversations of people in a voice channel on request.
This would make it easy to record your voice chat sessions from the perspective of someone in the channel. 
It also had planned features such as transcripting the sessions via OpenAI's Whisper.

At the moment, Discord Whisper is not being actively worked on due to the lack of a method to combine the audio from multiple users into one stream.
